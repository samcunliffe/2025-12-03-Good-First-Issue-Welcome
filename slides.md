# Thank you for coming!

The goal of this hackathon is to help new people make their first open-source contribution.
This could be:

- Fixing a bug. Adding a test.
- Improving documentation.
- Fixing broken links on a website.
- ...

A second goal is to work with someone you haven't worked with before!

## Plan of action

Break up into small groups or pairs. Find something. Work on it.

# Rough outline of the "how"...

Find a project and an issue you think you can fix. Looking for the ![h:1em](assets/good-first-issue-label.png) can help. Then read their contributor guidelines.

If a project doesn't have contributor guidelines, a typical workflow is:

1. [Fork] the project's repository, clone (`git clone`) your fork onto your laptop.
2. Fix the issue.
3. Commit (`git commit`) your fix, push to your fork (`git push`).
4. Open a [pull request].

Shout if you need help! There are at least 4 helpers around!

[pull request]: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests
